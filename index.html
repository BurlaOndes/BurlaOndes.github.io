I'm a PhD student in School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University where 
I'm advised by [Prof. Dr. Susan R. Hunter](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~hunter63/).
My research interests broadly include stochastic optimization, 
Monte Carlo simulation optimziation and analysis and, applied probability and statistics.
