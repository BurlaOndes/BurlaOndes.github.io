I'm a dual degree Ph.D. student in School of Industrial Engineering and M.S. student in Statistics-Computer Science Program at Purdue University where I'm advised by Prof. Dr. Susan R. Hunter. My research interests broadly include stochastic optimization, Monte Carlo simulation optimziation and analysis and, applied probability and statistics.
