<h1>Biography</h1>
I am a dual degree Ph.D. student in School of Industrial Engineering and M.S. student in 
Statistics-Computer Science Program at Purdue University where 
I am advised by <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~hunter63/">Prof. Dr. Susan R. Hunter</a>. 
My research interests broadly include stochastic optimization, 
Monte Carlo simulation optimziation and analysis and, applied probability and statistics.
