If you only decide to read one from the list, let it be this one. You will not regret your decision. This book has really special place in my heart, de Saint-Exup√©ry managed to define and criticize extremely complex people characteristics in such a simple way. 
My favorite quote from the book is: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.".</p>

Zweig is one of my favorite authors. I read more than 10 of his books and still enjoying reading his pieces. In Chess Story, he created another world with endless possibilities on the chessboard. He is an expert in using metaphors and descriptive narration. My favorite quote from the book is:"People and events do not disappoint us, our models of reality do. It is my model of reality that determines my happiness or disappointments.".
