I am interested in reading, making puzzle, drawing and swimming. Here are some books that I enjoyed reading.

<br>
If you decide to read just one book from the list, let it be this one. You won't regret your decision. This book holds a truly special place in my heart. Saint-Exupéry managed to define and critique the complexities of human characteristics in such a simple yet profound way.
My favorite quote from the book is: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game">2. Chess Story</a>
<br>

<br>
Stefan Zweig is one of my favorite authors. I've read more than ten of his books and still find enjoyment in his works. In 'Chess Story,' he skillfully constructs a world using a chessboard and explores the endless possibilities of the game. Zweig excels in the use of metaphors and descriptive narration.
My favorite quote from the book is: "People and events do not disappoint us; our models of reality do. It is my model of reality that determines my happiness or disappointments."
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato_and_a_Platypus_Walk_Into_a_Bar">3. Plato and Platypus walks into a bar </a>
<br>

<br>
If you are interested in philosophy, this book can serve as an excellent introduction. It helps readers grasp the fundamentals of philosophy through humor and jokes, making learning an enjoyable experience. Reading this book was pure joy.
However, a word of warning: if you don't want to disturb others with your laughter, avoid reading it in a quiet library :)
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memed,_My_Hawk">4. Memed, My Hawk </a>
<br>

<br>
My mother tongue is Turkish, and I would like to introduce people from all around the world to some of the best Turkish writers and books. 'Memed, My Hawk' is undoubtedly one of them; it is the first book in the 'Ince Memed' tetralogy. This book offers a unique experience and showcases Kemal's extraordinary talent in understanding and describing human nature. While the story is set in Cukurova, Turkey, it is a narrative that anyone, anywhere can find something to relate to.
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)">5. Blindness </a>
<br>

<br>
José Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and 'Blindness' was one of his works that contributed to this prestigious award. The novel delves into the theme of losing our most relied-upon sense: vision. In a world where everyone is free to act without the fear of recognition or judgment, we begin to witness the true nature of humanity.
My favorite quote from the book is: "Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are."
