## Some of My Favorite Books
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince">1. The Little Prince</a>
<br>

<br>
If you only decide to read one from the list, let it be this one. You will not regret your decision. This book has really special place in my heart, de Saint-Exup√©ry managed to define and criticize extremely complex people characteristics in such a simple way. 
<br>
My favorite quote from the book is: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.".
