## Some of My Favorite Books
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince">1. The Little Prince</a>
<br>

<br>
If you only decide to read one from the list, let it be this one. You will not regret your decision. This book has really special place in my heart, de Saint-Exup√©ry managed to define and criticize extremely complex people characteristics in such a simple way. 
My favorite quote from the book is: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.".
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game">2. Chess Story</a>
<br>

<br>
Zweig is one of my favorite authors. I read more than ten of his books and still enjoying his pieces. In Chess Story, he created a world with using chessboard and  game's endless possibilities. He is an expert in using metaphors and descriptive narration. My favorite quote from the book is:"People and events do not disappoint us, our models of reality do. It is my model of reality that determines my happiness or disappointments.".
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato_and_a_Platypus_Walk_Into_a_Bar">3. Plato and Platypus walks into a bar </a>
<br>

<br>
If you are interested in philosophy, this can be a great introduction book. The book helps reader to understand the fundamentals of philosophy through jokes. Readers learn while laughing. It was a pure joy to read this book. Warning: If you do not want to disturb others with your laughing, do not read this book in a quite library :)
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memed,_My_Hawk">4. Memed, My Hawk </a>
<br>

My mother tounge is Turkish and I would like to intoduce people from all around the world with some of the best Turkish writers and books. Memed, My Hawk is definetely one of them, it is the first book of Ince Memed tetralogy. This book is an experience and shows Kemal's extraordinary talent in understanding and describing human nature. The story takes place in Cukurova, Turkey; however, it is a story that anyone in anywhere can find something to take. 
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)">5. Blindness </a>
<br>

<br>
Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and Blindness was one of his works that led to the Nobel. The novel deals with the loss of our most relied upon sense: vision. When everybody is free to do whatever he/she wants without the fear of recognition and judgement, we start to see the true nature of humanity. My favorite quote from the book is: "Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truely are.".
