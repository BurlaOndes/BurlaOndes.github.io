## Some of My Favorite Books
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince">1. The Little Prince</a>
<br>

<br>
If you only decide to read one from the list, let it be this one. You will not regret your decision. This book has really special place in my heart, de Saint-Exup√©ry managed to define and criticize extremely complex people characteristics in such a simple way. 
My favorite quote from the book is: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.".
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game">2. Chess Story</a>
<br>

Zweig is one of my favorite authors. I read more than 10 of his books and still enjoying reading his pieces. In Chess Story, he created another world with endless possibilities on the chessboard. He is an expert in using metaphors and descriptive narration. My favorite quote from the book is:"People and events do not disappoint us, our models of reality do. It is my model of reality that determines my happiness or disappointments.".
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato_and_a_Platypus_Walk_Into_a_Bar">3. Plato and Platypus walks into a bar </a>
<br>

If you are interested in philosophy, this can be a great introduction book. The book helps reader to understand the fundamentals of philosophy through jokes. It was a pure joy to read this book. 
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memed,_My_Hawk">4. Memed, My Hawk </a>
<br>

My mother tounge is Turkish and I would like to intoduce people from all around the world with some of the best Turkish writers and books. Memed, My Hawk is definetely one of them, it is the first book of Ince Memed tetralogy. This book is an experience and shows Kemal's extraordinary talent in understanding and describing human nature. The story takes place in Cukurova, Turkey; however, it is a story that anyone in anywhere can find something to take.

<a href="">5. Today's Childeren is Wonderful </a>
